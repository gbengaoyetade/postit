# PostIt
PostIt is a group messaging application that allows registered users communicate prioritized messages
with one another. Messages are prioritized in the following order:
* Normal
* Urgent
* Critical

## Installation
To get Postit up and running on your local machine, you'll need to have the following installed:
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) : This powers the backend of the application
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) : This is the database used
* [Git](https://expressjs.com/) (optional but highly recommended): Version control system <br /><br />
Once you have all of these installed, run this command
`  git clone https://github.com/gbengaPS/postit.git  ` in your terminal<br /><br />
This will create a postit folder on your local machine<br /><br />
Change directory to postit `  cd postit  `<br /><br />
And then run  `  npm install  ` <br /><br />
This will install all dependencies.<br /><br />
You'll need to create a .env file, follow the pattern in the .env.example file. <br /><br />
Install sequelize cli globally `  npm install -g sequlize  ` and then run migrations `  sequelize db:migrate   `<br /><br />
To start the project, run `  npm start  `<br /><br />
This will start the server on port: 3000 <br /><br />

## Running the tests

Three categories of test have been written for this application:
* Server side tests: ` npm run test `
* Client side tests: ` npm run client:test `
* End-to-end test: ` npm run start:selenium ` and ` npm run e2e:test `

The end-to-end test requires that you have selenium driver installed
run this command to install selenium <br />
`npm install selenium-standalone --save-dev` <br />
Afterwards, run `e2e:setup`

### Note
Running the end-to-end test will drop your tables and create a new one
